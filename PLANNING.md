### 2.2 Architectural Principles

#### Edge-First Design
- **Compute at the edge**: Business logic in Workers (200+ global locations)
- **Data caching strategy**: Hot data in D1/KV, cold in PostgreSQL
- **Global performance**: <100ms latency worldwide
- **Zero cold starts**: Workers stay warm across requests

#### Serverless & Scalable
- **No infrastructure management**: Fully managed by Cloudflare
- **Auto-scaling**: Handle 0 to millions of requests
- **Pay-per-use**: Only pay for actual compute used
- **Infinite scale**: No practical upper limits

#### Security by Design
- **Zero Trust architecture**: Every request authenticated
- **Edge security**: Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection
- **Encryption everywhere**: TLS 1.3, encrypted at rest
- **Principle of least privilege**: Granular RBAC

#### Data Architecture
```yaml
Hot Data (Edge):
  - User sessions (Workers KV)
  - Recent cost data (D1)
  - Cached dashboards (R2)
  - Real-time metrics (Durable Objects)

Warm Data (Accelerated):
  - 30-day cost history (Prisma Accelerate)
  - Active configurations (Cached)
  - Frequently accessed reports

Cold Data (PostgreSQL):
  - Historical data >30 days
  - Audit logs
  - Compliance records
  - Backups
```

### 2.3 Multi-Tenancy Strategy

```typescript
// Tenant Isolation Model
interface TenantIsolation {
  // Data Isolation
  database: 'shared_db_row_level_security';
  schema: 'tenant_id_on_every_table';
  
  // Compute Isolation  
  workers: 'shared_with_tenant_context';
  rateLimiting: 'per_tenant_quotas';
  
  // Storage Isolation
  r2Buckets: 'prefix_per_tenant';
  kvNamespaces: 'key_prefix_isolation';
  
  // Network Isolation
  customDomains: 'tenant.finops.app';
  apiKeys: 'tenant_scoped_tokens';
}
```

### 2.4 Service Architecture

  - OAuth 2.0 flow management
  - JWT token generation/validation
  - RBAC enforcement
  - Session management
  - MFA support

  - FOCUS normalization
  - Cost allocation engine
  - Anomaly detection
